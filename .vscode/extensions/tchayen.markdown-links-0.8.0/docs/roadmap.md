# Roadmap

This is early development version. I am currently considering:

- [x] Setting for choosing column for opening files.
- [x] Support for Zettlr-style ID-based links.
- [x] Highlighting of focused file.
- [ ] Automated tests. _WIP by [@tchayen](https://github.com/tchayen)_
- [ ] ~~Dark theme support (+ auto detecting system's dark/light mode).~~ Support for detecting theme's colors was added.
- [ ] Zoom button controls (`+` / `-` / `reset`).
- [ ] Optional displaying of external URLs in the graph.
- [ ] Ignoring files or directories.
- [ ] Some directory controls within the graph view (adding, removing files).
- [ ] Configurable parameters of graph simulation.
- [ ] Optional display of edge directions.
- [ ] Better examples.
- [x] Optional autostart.

2. Click `cmd+shift+p` to open the command palette and enter `add to playbook`

   _Click `alt+p` (`option+p` on Mac) as a shortcut for step 2._

3. Follow the prompts to add your code snippet to a playbook!

### Opening playbooks

1. Click `cmd+shift+p` to open the command palette and enter `open playbook`
2. Select a playbook from the drop-down and it will open in your browser

## Use Cases

This is the first release of Playbooks outside of our own team. The MVP has a bunch of rough edges, but has already surprised us in how hard it is to stop using once we adopted it as a team. Some of the use cases we've already naturally started using it for include:

_Tracking Tech Debt, Specifications, Refactoring, TODOs, Technical Discussions, Questions / Comprehension, Planning out work for other devs, Planning out work for ourselves..._

...and the list continues to grow. We'd love to hear what use cases you've found too!

## Feedback

We're looking for as much feedback as early as possible. We'd love to learn more about your experience: [feedback form ðŸ“‹](https://jesse094360.typeform.com/to/sMmjdbVm)

Within that rule you may only use query.client.geoKey in the caseCondition expressions for defining the cases. For each case in the PRIORITY rule each answer pool must have a unique priority value assigned to it. Answer data can only be defined within cases and defaultAnswerData cannot be used in the PRIORITY rule.\nROUTE_BY_ASN requires exactly one PRIORITY rule that ranks answers by pool using the ASN of the client as a condition.

For each case in the PRIORITY rule each answer pool must have a unique priority value assigned to it.

For each case in the PRIORITY rule each answer pool must have a unique priority value assigned to it.

Example: {\"Department\": \"Finance\"} \nipxe_script - (Optional) This is an advanced option.\n  When a bare metal or virtual machine instance boots, the iPXE firmware that runs on the instance is configured to run an iPXE script to continue the boot process.\n  If you want more control over the boot process, you can provide your own custom iPXE script that will run when the instance boots; however, you should be aware that the same iPXE script will run every time an instance boots; not only after the initial LaunchInstance call.\n  The default iPXE script connects to the instance's local boot volume over iSCSI and performs a network boot. If you use a custom iPXE script and want to network-boot from the instance's local boot volume over iSCSI the same way as the default iPXE script, you should use the following iSCSI IP address: 169.254.0.2, and boot volume IQN: iqn.2015-02.oracle.boot.\n  For more information about the Bring Your Own Image feature of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, see Bring Your Own Image.\n  For more information about iPXE, see http://ipxe.org. \n\nmetadata - (Optional) Custom metadata key/value pairs that you provide, such as the SSH public key required to connect to the instance.\n  A metadata service runs on every launched instance. The service is an HTTP endpoint listening on 169.254.169.254. You can use the service to:\n\nProvide information to Cloud-Init to be used for various system initialization tasks.\nGet information about the instance, including the custom metadata that you provide when you launch the instance.\nProviding Cloud-Init Metadata\nYou can use the following metadata key names to provide information to Cloud-Init:\n\"ssh_authorized_keys\" - Provide one or more public SSH keys to be included in the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file for the default user on the instance. Use a newline character to separate multiple keys. The SSH keys must be in the format necessary for the authorized_keys file, as shown in the example below.\n\"user_data\" - Provide your own base64-encoded data to be used by Cloud-Init to run custom scripts or provide custom Cloud-Init configuration. For information about how to take advantage of user data, see the Cloud-Init Documentation.\nNote: Cloud-Init does not pull this data from the http://169.254.169.254/opc/v1/instance/metadata/ path. When the instance launches and either of these keys are provided, the key values are formatted as OpenStack metadata and copied to the following locations, which are recognized by Cloud-Init:\nhttp://169.254.169.254/openstack/latest/meta_data.json - This JSON blob contains, among other things, the SSH keys that you provided for \"ssh_authorized_keys\".\nhttp://169.254.169.254/openstack/latest/user_data - Contains the base64-decoded data that you provided for \"user_data\".\nMetadata Example\n\"metadata\" : { \"quake_bot_level\" : \"Severe\", \"ssh_authorized_keys\" : \"ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAACAQCZ06fccNTQfq+xubFlJ5ZR3kt+uzspdH9tXL+lAejSM1NXM+CFZev7MIxfEjas06y80ZBZ7DUTQO0GxJPeD8NCOb1VorF8M4xuLwrmzRtkoZzU16umt4y1W0Q4ifdp3IiiU0U8/WxczSXcUVZOLqkz5dc6oMHdMVpkimietWzGZ4LBBsH/LjEVY7E0V+a0sNchlVDIZcm7ErReBLcdTGDq0uLBiuChyl6RUkX1PNhusquTGwK7zc8OBXkRuubn5UKXhI3Ul9Nyk4XESkVWIGNKmw8mSpoJSjR8P9ZjRmcZVo8S+x4KVPMZKQEor== ryan.smith@company.com ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABJQAAAQEAzJSAtwEPoB3Jmr58IXrDGzLuDYkWAYg8AsLYlo6JZvKpjY1xednIcfEVQJm4T2DhVmdWhRrwQ8DmayVZvBkLt+zs2LdoAJEVimKwXcJFD/7wtH8Lnk17HiglbbbNXsemjDY0hea4JUE5CfvkIdZBITuMrfqSmA4n3VNoorXYdvtTMoGG8fxMub46RPtuxtqi9bG9Zqenordkg5FJt2mVNfQRqf83CWojcOkklUWq4CjyxaeLf5i9gv1fRoBo4QhiA8I6NCSppO8GnoV/6Ox6TNoh9BiifqGKC9VGYuC89RvUajRBTZSK2TK4DPfaT+2R+slPsFrwiT/oPEhhEK1S5Q== rsa-key-20160227\", \"user_data\" : \"SWYgeW91IGNhbiBzZWUgdGhpcywgdGhlbiBpdCB3b3JrZWQgbWF5YmUuCg==\" } Getting Metadata on the Instance\nTo get information about your instance, connect to the instance using SSH and issue any of the following GET requests:\ncurl http://169.254.169.254/opc/v1/instance/ curl http://169.254.169.254/opc/v1/instance/metadata/ curl http://169.254.169.254/opc/v1/instance/metadata/\nYou'll get back a response that includes all the instance information; only the metadata information; or the metadata information for the specified key name, respectively. \n\n\n\nshape - (Optional) The shape of an instance.

If you use a custom iPXE script and want to network-boot from the instance's local boot volume over iSCSI the same way as the default iPXE script, you should use the following iSCSI IP address: 169.254.0.2, and boot volume IQN: iqn.2015-02.oracle.boot.\n  For more information about the Bring Your Own Image feature of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, see Bring Your Own Image.\n  For more information about iPXE, see http://ipxe.org. \n\nmetadata - (Optional) Custom metadata key/value pairs that you provide, such as the SSH public key required to connect to the instance.\n  A metadata service runs on every launched instance.

You can use the service to:\n\nProvide information to Cloud-Init to be used for various system initialization tasks.\nGet information about the instance, including the custom metadata that you provide when you launch the instance.\nProviding Cloud-Init Metadata\nYou can use the following metadata key names to provide information to Cloud-Init:\n\"ssh_authorized_keys\" - Provide one or more public SSH keys to be included in the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file for the default user on the instance. Use a newline character to separate multiple keys. The SSH keys must be in the format necessary for the authorized_keys file, as shown in the example below.\n\"user_data\" - Provide your own base64-encoded data to be used by Cloud-Init to run custom scripts or provide custom Cloud-Init configuration. For information about how to take advantage of user data, see the Cloud-Init Documentation.\nNote: Cloud-Init does not pull this data from the http://169.254.169.254/opc/v1/instance/metadata/ path.

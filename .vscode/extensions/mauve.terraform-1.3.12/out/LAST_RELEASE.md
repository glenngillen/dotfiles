# 1.3.12

Sadly, I am currently very busy with my work so I cannot dedicate anytime to this project, however I am very lucky to have enthuastic users who have stepped up and started to fix small issues and add some features.

Terraform 0.12 support is still not available, but some progress is being made in issue https://github.com/mauve/vscode-terraform/issues/157 if you want to see this support land, I would kindly ask you to get involved with the users in that ticket.

GitLens provides rich integrations with many remote providers, including GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, Gitea, Gerrit, Bitbucket, Bitbucket Server, Azure DevOps and custom servers.

All Git host integrations provide issue and pull request auto-linking, while advanced integrations (e.g. GitHub) provide more detailed hover information, plus the ability to associate pull requests with branches/commits, and avatars.
